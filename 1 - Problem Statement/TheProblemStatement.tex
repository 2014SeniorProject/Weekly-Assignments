\section{Inactivity}
\PARstart{I}{nactivity}Inactivity is becoming an increasingly large problem all around the world. Human beings must get regular exercise to keep their bodies in shape and free of sickness. It is becoming even more apparent, with an increasing amount of research being done across the globe, that physical activity also helps keep the mind healthy. This problem of people being inactive is not restricted to any specific socio economic sector.

Since the the advent of horse drawn carriages, humans have been finding easier ways to travel which require less physical work. Now that most modern societies contain acces to cars, taxis, busses, subways and the like, It’s becoming much easier to get to where you need to be without having to walk much further than the length of your driveway.  As generations of people became so used to getting around by motorized vehicles, even children came to see this as the best solution to travel. People of all ages around the world are using motorized transportation of sometype. They could be driving their own car, riding a bus, an elderly care van, or being driven to school by their parents. The reasons for this behavior can range greatly. Some people see it as safer because walking in certain areas can have different dangers associated with it at certain times of the day. People in a modernized society especially, simply don’t have time to walk the distance required to get to work, school, stores, and friends houses. 

Leisure used to mean going outside, playing some sort of game with friends or family. Maybe some swimming, hiking, something of that sort. Increasingly it means sitting in front of a Television, computer monitor, or cellphone. [[We can get tooonnnns of statistics here]]]. This is more prevalent in developed nations such as the US, however, technology is increasing worldwide at a substantial rate. Many times when people want to go out and get away from activities like that, they simply go to a movie theater, see a play, or eat at a restaurant. Much of our modern leisure is sedentary.

A large percentage of modern jobs require people to sit in one position for the majority of the day. [[[Insert Penile Statistics HERE]]]. Desk jobs, cubicles, computer work, and meeting all involve sitting in one spot for extended periods of time.

School is completely necessary, but again, requires students to simply sit in the same position for extended periods of time. During the earlier years of school, there is usualy a small amount of time set asside for Physical Educatin. However people can be waived from this for all sorts of reasons, even for being too out of shape[[[A statistic here would be nice]]]]]. The people that are able to get PE waived are, a lot of the time, the ones who could benifit from it the most. 

Sleep, school, work, leisure, and going in between all of those activities, generally make up the majority of peoples’ day. It is very common that modern humans try to pack in as much as they can as efficiently as they can, so it is very rare to be able to devote more than an hour to some outside cause like exersize. But what if there was a way to fit in exersize with only adding a few incriments of 10-15 minutes throughout your day? How would that benifit a human, and how can it be done?

\section{Health Effects}
 \PARstart{I}{nactivity} carries with it major detrimental effects to human health including physical and mental afflictions.  The physical and mental handicaps include stress, depression, obesity and heart disease.  These afflictions carry with them a reduced life span, inflated health insurance costs and a lower quality of life.

Obesity is an elevated topic of discussion because of the great number of detrimental effects it has on the human body.  Each year there are 2.8 million deaths worldwide caused by being overweight or obese.  35\% of all adults twenty years of age or older were overweight, with a large number of them being obese, according to a survey in 2008. (WHO Obesity).  Obesity and inactivity can cause cardiovascular disease, high cholesterol, diabetes, different types of cancers and a number of psychological ailments.  Nearly half of all adults worldwide are affected by cardiovascular disease which  contributes to stroke and kidney failure.  There were an estimated 17.3 million deaths caused by cardiovascular disease accounting for 30\% of all deaths worldwide making it the number one cause of death.  Hypertension alone, a form of cardiovascular disease, is responsible for 9.4 million deaths per year worldwide.  Diabetes doubles the risk of death compared to peers of the same age.  Diabetes will damage the heart, kidney, nerves and even blood vessels.
Not only does inactivity aid in causing the previous physical effects, physical activity can alleviate or even cure these effects entirely. Physical activity increases energy levels with as little as 30 minutes of exertion a day.  This can promote many benefits at home and in the workplace such as increased energy and facilitate daily tasks.  Adequate physical activity coupled with sleep can provide energy throughout the day which can increase focus on any task, physical or not.  Regular physical activity will increase cardiorespiratory and muscular fitness.

\section{Options}
\PARstart{T}{here} are many different options for indivuals to combat the adverse health effects of a sedentary lifestyle. From medications that suppress symptoms, to extreme diets that aleviate certain problems. However, both of those solutions can potentially create other health problems of their own. The best way to avoid health problems stemming from inactivity, is simply to become more active. Recent studies suggest that at least 30 minutes of activity per day can [[[statistics]]]]. This exercise can come from something as simple as walking.
Going to the gym, swimming, playing physical sports, walking

\section{Introduction}
% Computer Society journal papers do something a tad strange with the very
% first section heading (almost always called "Introduction"). They place it
% ABOVE the main text! IEEEtran.cls currently does not do this for you.
% However, You can achieve this effect by making LaTeX jump through some
% hoops via something like:
%
%\ifCLASSOPTIONcompsoc
%  \noindent\raisebox{2\baselineskip}[0pt][0pt]%
%  {\parbox{\columnwidth}{\section{Introduction}\label{sec:introduction}%
%  \global\everypar=\everypar}}%
%  \vspace{-1\baselineskip}\vspace{-\parskip}\par
%\else
%  \section{Introduction}\label{sec:introduction}\par
%\fi
%
% Admittedly, this is a hack and may well be fragile, but seems to do the
% trick for me. Note the need to keep any \label that may be used right
% after \section in the above as the hack puts \section within a raised box.



% The very first letter is a 2 line initial drop letter followed
% by the rest of the first word in caps (small caps for compsoc).
% 
% form to use if the first word consists of a single letter:
% \IEEEPARstart{A}{demo} file is ....
% 
% form to use if you need the single drop letter followed by
% normal text (unknown if ever used by IEEE):
% \IEEEPARstart{A}{}demo file is ....
% 
% Some journals put the first two words in caps:
% \IEEEPARstart{T}{his demo} file is ....
% 
% Here we have the typical use of a "T" for an initial drop letter
% and "HIS" in caps to complete the first word.
\IEEEPARstart{T}{his} demo file is intended to serve as a ``starter file''
for IEEE Computer Society journal papers produced under \LaTeX\ using
IEEEtran.cls version 1.7 and later.
% You must have at least 2 lines in the paragraph with the drop letter
% (should never be an issue)
I wish you the best of success.

% An example of a floating figure using the graphicx package.
% Note that \label must occur AFTER (or within) \caption.
% For figures, \caption should occur after the \includegraphics.
% Note that IEEEtran v1.7 and later has special internal code that
% is designed to preserve the operation of \label within \caption
% even when the captionsoff option is in effect. However, because
% of issues like this, it may be the safest practice to put all your
% \label just after \caption rather than within \caption{}.
%
% Reminder: the "draftcls" or "draftclsnofoot", not "draft", class
% option should be used if it is desired that the figures are to be
% displayed while in draft mode.

%\end{figure}

% Note that IEEE typically puts floats only at the top, even when this
% results in a large percentage of a column being occupied by floats.
% However, the Computer Society has been known to put floats at the bottom.


% An example of a double column floating figure using two subfigures.
% (The subfig.sty package must be loaded for this to work.)
% The subfigure \label commands are set within each subfloat command, the
% \label for the overall figure must come after \caption.
% \hfil must be used as a separator to get equal spacing.
% The subfigure.sty package works much the same way, except \subfigure is
% used instead of \subfloat.

%\label{fig_second_case}}}
%\caption{Simulation results}
%\label{fig_sim}
%\end{figure*}
%
% Note that often IEEE papers with subfigures do not employ subfigure
% captions (using the optional argument to \subfloat), but instead will
% reference/describe all of them (a), (b), etc., within the main caption.


% An example of a floating table. Note that, for IEEE style tables, the 
% \caption command should come BEFORE the table. Table text will default to
% \footnotesize as IEEE normally uses this smaller font for tables.
% The \label must come after \caption as always.
%
%\begin{table}[!t]
%% increase table row spacing, adjust to taste
%\renewcommand{\arraystretch}{1.3}
% if using array.sty, it might be a good idea to tweak the value of
% \extrarowheight as needed to properly center the text within the cells
%\caption{An Example of a Table}
%\label{table_example}

%% Some packages, such as MDW tools, offer better commands for making tables
%% than the plain LaTeX2e tabular which is used here.

%One & Two\\
%\hline
%Three & Four\\
%\hline
%\end{tabular}
%\end{table}


% Note that IEEE does not put floats in the very first column - or typically
% anywhere on the first page for that matter. Also, in-text middle ("here")
% positioning is not used. Most IEEE journals use top floats exclusively.
% However, Computer Society journals sometimes do use bottom floats - bear
% this in mind when choosing appropriate optional arguments for the
% figure/table environments.
% Note that, LaTeX2e, unlike IEEE journals, places footnotes above bottom
% floats. This can be corrected via the \fnbelowfloat command of the
% stfloats package.
